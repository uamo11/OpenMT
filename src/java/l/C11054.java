Send edits as edits[] items with mode, matchText, and writeText; top-level mode/matchText/writeText are invalid. edit_text rejects stale targetVersion values for that exact target; dex_method targetVersion is scoped to the method text, not the owner class. Local edits match the same LF-normalized original target text and apply atomically; any failed edit leaves the session unchanged. Use one write_target for a whole-target write, including targetVersion=\"missing\" to create a missing dex_class, axml, or zip_entry. Use mt_apk_delete_target to remove a whole class, method, AXML, text, or binary ZIP entry without first reading it. Local modes replace_match/insert_before_match/insert_after_match require exactly one occurrence of matchText; replace_match with writeText=\"\" still deletes only the matched text. On TEXT_MATCH_AMBIGUOUS, retry with longer surrounding context.
